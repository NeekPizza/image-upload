# Front End

### Install Dependencies

`cd` into the `client` directory and run `npm install`.

### Start the front end

To start the React application, run `npm start` while in the `client` directory.

# Back End

### Install Dependencies

`cd` into the `server` directory and run `npm install`.

### Database

This application utilizes MongoDB, ensure that you have it installed and a service for it running. The installation documentation can be found [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/).

### Start the back end

To start the React application, run `npm start` while in the `server` directory. If you started the front end before following the back end steps, refreshing your browser should fix any errors.

### Given more time

Given more time, I would have liked to explore using a UI library, but because I anticipated building upon the current implementation, I kept the UI simple. I would have liked to componentized more of the front end. I would also have liked to add StoryBook for viewing and testing components. Something that would also have been good to add is Cypress for e2e testing.
